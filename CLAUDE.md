# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

FPGA accelerator for 3D (x, y, theta) Value Iteration path planning, targeting Ultra96-V2 (Zynq UltraScale+ ZU3EG). Goal: solve a 14000×800×60 campus map in <60 s. A Vitis HLS kernel (`vi_sweep`) is driven from Linux user-space through a UIO + u-dma-buf device layer and exercised by a C CLI plus host-side reference solver. Phase plan and design specs live in `docs/superpowers/specs/` and `docs/superpowers/plans/` — read them before making non-trivial changes to algorithms, datatypes, or memory layout.

## Build & Test

Top-level `Makefile` delegates to `driver/uio/` and `host/`. Run from the repo root unless noted.

- `make driver` — build `libvi_sweep.a` / `.so` (UIO + u-dma-buf Linux ops + mock).
- `make host` — build `host/vi_cli` linked against the Linux libvi_sweep.
- `make test-host` — build mock-only lib and run all host unit tests (`host/test/test_*.c`). No FPGA needed.
- `make test-hw` — HW integration via SSH. Requires `VI_TARGET_HOST=<ultra96-hostname>`; runs `host/test/hw/run_smoke.sh` then `run_big.sh`, which scp the CLI + generated maps to the target and execute `vi_cli --verify` there.
- Run a single host test: `make -C host test/test_penalty.run` (pattern: `test/<name>.run`).
- Host-only CLI with the mock backend (no UIO needed, useful for local debugging): `make -C host cli-mock` → `host/vi_cli_mock`.

### FPGA build (`fpga/scripts/Makefile`)

Tools must be on `PATH` — invoke bare `vitis_hls` / `vivado` (Vitis 2025.2). Do **not** prefix with `source settings.sh`.

- `make -C fpga/scripts csim` — HLS C-simulation of tile-based kernel (`fpga/hls/vi_sweep_tile/`).
- `make -C fpga/scripts csim_stream` — HLS C-simulation of streaming kernel (`fpga/hls/vi_sweep_stream/`).
- `make -C fpga/scripts hls` — HLS synth + IP export (tile-based) into `fpga/scripts/hls_build_tile/`.
- `make -C fpga/scripts hls_stream` — HLS synth + IP export (streaming) into `fpga/scripts/hls_build_stream/`.
- `make -C fpga/scripts vivado` (or `bitstream`) — runs HLS then `build_vivado.tcl` to produce the Ultra96-V2 bitstream under `fpga/vivado/ultra96v2/vi_ultra96v2/`.
- After regenerating HLS IP, sync the register header into the driver: `make -C driver/uio sync-hw-header` (copies `xvi_sweep_hw.h` into `driver/uio/generated/`; review the diff).

## Architecture

Four vertically integrated layers share the same 16-bit data contract defined in `fpga/hls/vi_sweep_tile/src/vi_types.h` (tile-based) and `fpga/hls/vi_sweep_stream/src/vi_stream_types.h` (streaming). Keep them in sync.

### 1. HLS kernel (`fpga/hls/vi_sweep_tile/` and `fpga/hls/vi_sweep_stream/`)
Dataflow kernel `vi_sweep_top` = `load_tiles` → `compute_bellman` → `store_tiles`, processing 32×32 tiles with a 6-cell halo (TILE_W_H = 44). Two CUs are instantiated in the Vivado BD for red/black tile sweeping. Datatypes: `value_t`/`penalty_t` are `ap_uint<16>`; offsets `ap_int<8>`. Sentinels: `PENALTY_OBSTACLE = 0xFFFF` (impassable); `PENALTY_GOAL = 0xFFFE` — **when read as a neighbor's penalty it must be treated as 0** so the goal cell's value stays pinned at 0 (this convention is load-bearing; see the testbench and `host/src/penalty.c`). Transition table is a packed `(dix, diy, dit)` word per `(action, theta)` — 6×60 = 360 entries, precomputed on ARM and DMA'd into the kernel.

### 2. Device layer (`driver/uio/`)
`vi_device.h` defines a `vi_device_ops_t` vtable (init/shutdown/read_reg/write_reg/wait_irq/map_buf) with two implementations:
- `vi_device_linux.c` — real UIO + u-dma-buf (requires the device-tree overlay in `driver/dts/vi_sweep.dtsi` applied via Petalinux on the target).
- `vi_device_mock.c` — in-memory software model used for host unit tests and `cli-mock`.

`libvi_sweep.c` sits on top of the vtable and exposes the public API (`libvi_sweep.h`). Build flavors:
- `libvi_sweep.a` / `.so` — full build, both backends.
- `libvi_sweep_mock.a` — built with `-DVI_MOCK_ONLY`, no Linux ops; used by `test-host` and `cli-mock`. Any code touching `vi_linux_ops` must be guarded by `#ifndef VI_MOCK_ONLY`.

Register offsets come from the HLS-generated `xvi_sweep_hw.h`; never hand-edit `driver/uio/generated/xvi_sweep_hw.h` — regenerate via `sync-hw-header` after an HLS rebuild.

### 3. Host CLI + reference (`host/`)
`vi_cli.c` loads a PGM map + YAML metadata (`map_pgm.c`), builds the penalty field (`penalty.c`), computes the transition table (`transitions.c`), opens the vi_sweep device, runs sweeps, and optionally verifies against `vi_reference_c.c` (pure-C value iteration matching the HLS testbench reference). `--verify` asserts bit-exact equality vs the reference; this is the oracle for HW correctness. Unit tests in `host/test/` exercise each module and a full mock-backed run (`test_vi_run_mock.c`, `test_reference_eq.c`).

### 4. FPGA/board bring-up (`fpga/vivado/`, `fpga/pynq/`)
`create_bd.tcl` / `create_project.tcl` build the Vivado block design wrapping two `vi_sweep` CUs with AXI and interrupts. `fpga/pynq/` holds bitstream + hwh + a PYNQ-side overlay helper for pre-Linux-driver experimentation on Ultra96-V2.

## Conventions

- C code: `-std=c11 -Wall -Wextra -Werror`. Keep new code warning-clean or the build breaks.
- When changing the HLS data contract (types, tile size, sentinels, transition packing), update `vi_types.h`, `host/src/vi_reference_c.c`, `host/src/penalty.c`/`transitions.c`, and the mock device in lockstep, and re-run `make test-host`.
- Goal-cell handling: the `PENALTY_GOAL` → 0 substitution when read as a neighbor's penalty is required — do not "simplify" it away.
- HW tests are SSH-driven. They assume the target already has the bitstream loaded and the `vi_sweep` overlay applied; they do not program the FPGA themselves.

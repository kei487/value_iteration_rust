# Run colcon from $REPO_ROOT (not $WS) so the generated cargo config is found,
# and use --merge-install so the linker finds vi_interfaces' C libs:
#
#  1. config discovery: colcon-ros-cargo writes the generated `.cargo/config.toml`
#     (the [patch.crates-io] redirects to the locally-built rclrs / message /
#     vi_interfaces crates) into colcon's current working directory. The package
#     sources are symlinked into $WS/src, and cargo canonicalizes its cwd through
#     those symlinks to the real paths under $REPO_ROOT/vi_ros2 before searching
#     upward for `.cargo/config.toml`. Run from $WS and the config lands in
#     $WS/.cargo, which the real source tree never sees, so the patches go unused
#     and cargo fails to resolve the ROS crates from crates.io. Running from
#     $REPO_ROOT puts it at $REPO_ROOT/.cargo/config.toml, the common ancestor of
#     both the real package sources and the ../../vi_rs/* path deps.
#
#  2. --merge-install: rosidl_runtime_rs's build.rs adds `<prefix>/lib` to the
#     linker search path for each prefix on AMENT_PREFIX_PATH. With the default
#     isolated install each package gets its own prefix and vi_interfaces' C
#     typesupport libs (libvi_interfaces__rosidl_*_c.so) are not found when
#     linking vi_node. A single merged prefix ($WS/install/lib) puts them on the
#     search path (this is also how the Dockerfile builds rclrs).
